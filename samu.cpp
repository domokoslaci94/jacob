 * SAMU
 *
 * The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and
 * verification of the results of the paper entitled "A disembodied
 * developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai". It is our hope
 * that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter
 * bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
